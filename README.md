Assignment: Multi-threaded Timer
Task
Write a Java console application with which you can start multiple timers. Timers run independently of each other and measure time in seconds (no need to be super precise).

Features
Users can

Start timers and give them a Name.
Stop a timer by Name.
Check a timer by Name or all timers (without a Name ).
Starting a timer creates a new thread which increments a counter to keep track of elapsed seconds. Starting an already stopped timer restarts it.

Stopping a timer interrupts the thread created when the timer was started effectively stopping the timer (the counter won't be incremented anymore). Timer threads should check/handle and react accordingly for interrupts while they execute.

Checking a timer prints information about the timer itself: it's name, it's thread ID and the elapsed seconds. Users can check timers that are already stopped.

Requirements
Use Thread s or Runnable s.
Use interrupt.
Commit your work into a Git repository and submit your repo's URL.
Example Scenario
Command?
start TEA

Command?
check
Name: TEA, ThreadId: 11, Seconds: 1

... after 7 seconds ...

Command?
start COFFEE

Command?
check
Name: TEA, ThreadId: 11, Seconds: 8
Name: COFFEE, ThreadId: 12, Seconds: 1

... after 5 seconds ...

Command?
stop TEA
TEA received interrupt while sleeping

... after 16 seconds ...

Command?
check
Name: TEA, ThreadId: 11, Seconds: 13
Name: COFFEE, ThreadId: 12, Seconds: 22

... after 8 seconds ...

Command?
start TEA

Command?
check
Name: TEA, ThreadId: 13, Seconds: 15
Name: COFFEE, ThreadId: 12, Seconds: 30

... after 4 seconds ...

Command?
exit
Name: TEA, ThreadId: 13, Seconds: 19
Name: COFFEE, ThreadId: 12, Seconds: 34
